# Punitive Action

This page defines how punitive and administrative actions should escalate in practice.

```admonish info
Use the least severe intervention that still protects current player experience, restores round integrity, and sets a clear expectation.
```

## Escalation Path

| Level | Primary Tool | Use When | Required Follow-Through |
|:------|:-------------|:---------|:------------------------|
| 0 | Coaching / clarification | Confusion, first-time low-impact issue, no clear bad faith | Explain expectation and desired correction |
| 1 | Note | Rule violation occurred and needs a durable accountability record | Keep it brief; log facts, context, admin action, and player response |
| 2 | Watchlist | Patterned concerns need cross-admin visibility | Document what to monitor and why; reassess periodically |
| 3 | Role/game punitive action | Repetition, refusal, severe impact, or bad faith | Apply proportionate action and document rationale in notes |
| 4 | Whitelist revocation consideration | Persistent bad fit despite correction/escalation | Seek concurrence when practical and document internal rationale |

`Message` remains available as a non-punitive profile-context tool, but it is not part of punitive escalation for rulebreaking.

## Tool Standards

![Message, Note, and Watchlist reference](note_message_watchlist.png)

### Direct Staff Message (`message`)

Use a message as a non-punitive profile note for important context staff should remember.

Example: "This player performs as an excellent ERT role or CC guard when required. Very robust."

| Do | Avoid |
|:---|:------|
| Be concise, factual, and useful for future staff context | Vague, emotional, or editorial language |
| Record noteworthy positive or neutral context that is relevant to moderation operations | Using `message` as a punishment record |
| Keep it informational and non-disciplinary | Mixing disciplinary conclusions into profile context |

### Player Note (`note`)

Use notes as the durable staff record and the first punitive step after coaching/clarification when a rule violation occurs.

Notes should be brief and should be applied whenever an incident needs to be on-record for future escalation decisions.

| Must Include | Why |
|:-------------|:----|
| What happened (objective facts) | Future staff can quickly understand incident context |
| What action was taken | Escalation history remains consistent |
| Why action was chosen | Makes review/appeal decisions coherent |
| Player response/intent signals | Distinguishes confusion from bad faith |

### Watchlist (`watchlist`)

Watchlist sends a login notification to online admins whenever the flagged player joins.

| Apply Watchlist When | Remove/Review When |
|:---------------------|:-------------------|
| Repeated edge-case conduct across rounds | Behavior stabilizes for a meaningful period |
| Prior incidents show pattern risk | Original concern is no longer current |
| Staff needs continuity on a known issue | New evidence changes risk assessment |

```admonish info
Watchlist is for coordinated awareness, not pre-judgment.
```

## Applied Enforcement Escalation

Use this as the single escalation ladder from least severe to most severe.

```admonish info
The esclation lader does not require staff to accomplish each step before going to the next one. Events which have serious impact on the gameplay of other players, the round's integrity, or general spirit and expectations of the community may be esclated to a "rung" that is effective in setting a clear expectation. 

Uncooperation or untruthfulness from players during an administrative investigation is an acceptable cause to increase punishment severity. 
```

| Stage | Action | Severity Guidance | Expires In (Typical) | Use When |
|:------|:-------|:------------------|:---------------------|:---------|
| 1 | Coaching / clarification | Lowest | N/A | First-time, low-impact confusion; clear correction path exists |
| 2 | Note (first punitive step) | Low to medium | N/A | Rule violation needs brief durable documentation for accountability and future escalation |
| 3 | Watchlist | Medium | N/A | Pattern concerns require cross-admin visibility on login |
| 4 | Role Ban | Medium to high | 12h, 3d, 7d, 15d, perm | Misconduct is role-specific (for example recurring Rule 10.1 failures in Security/Command roles) |
| 5 | Server/Game Ban | High to critical | 12h, 3d, 7d, 15d, perm | Behavior is severe, repeated, bad-faith, or not contained to a single role |
| 6 | Combined Ban Action | Highest | Usually 7d, 15d, or perm | Both role misuse and broader game-impact concerns are present |

`Message` may still be used in parallel for useful non-punitive context, but does not replace a required note when rulebreaking occurred.

![Banning panel reference](banningpanel.png)

When using the panel, set fields in this order: **Type** -> **Severity** -> **Expires In**.

| Panel Option | What It Means | Typical Use |
|:-------------|:--------------|:------------|
| Type: Role Ban | Restricts specific jobs or departments only | Role-scoped issues (for example recurring Rule 10.1 performance failures) |
| Type: Server/Game Ban | Removes access to the server as a whole | Severe, repeated, or broad bad-faith behavior not limited to one role |
| Severity | Internal seriousness marker for the action | Keep proportional to impact, intent, and history |
| Expires In: 12h | Short timeout-style ban | Immediate cooling-off period for lower-severity incidents |
| Expires In: 3d | Medium short-term ban | Repeated lower-severity issues or a stronger first punitive step |
| Expires In: 7d | Medium-term ban | Significant disruption, refusal to correct, or repeated misconduct |
| Expires In: 15d | Long-term ban | Serious or persistent behavior with high player-impact |
| Expires In: Perm | Permanent ban | Extreme harm, persistent bad fit, or repeated failure across prior escalation |

Default to the least severe option that still protects player experience and round integrity.

## Example Scenarios

```admonish example
**Captain Overreach (Complaint-Led, Role-Specific)**

Complaint: HoS reports that a Captain executed a player for stealing from the bar.

Response:
- Investigate first and speak directly with the Captain to understand their reasoning.
- If the player demonstrates they do not understand the issue and are not remorseful, escalate to a temporary **Captain Role Ban**.
- Document the complaint source, findings, conversation outcome, and role-ban rationale in the staff action record.
```

```admonish example
**Security Officer Repeat Behavior (Complaint-Led Progression)**

Complaint 1: Security Officer shoots a Xenoqueen boarding evac. This is the player's first offense of any type and they are remorseful and understanding.

Response 1:
- Apply a **brief note** with a 1-week expiry as the proportional first response.

Complaint 2 (3 days later): Same player is fighting on the evac shuttle with someone they claim is a syndicate traitor.

Response 2:
- Treat as repeated role-performance misconduct.
- Escalate to a temporary **Security Role Ban**.
- Document the recurrence window (3 days), prior corrective action, and why role restriction is now necessary.
```

```admonish example
**Self-Antag Escalation from Watchlist to Ban**

Incident 1: Player breaks into Security to steal from the Security Vendor, claiming they need the nullspace flasher. They are understanding and cooperative.

Response 1:
- Apply a **watchlist** due to apparent repeat-attempt risk.
- Give a clear stop instruction and confirm understanding.

Incident 2: Player repeats the behavior (self-antagging).

Response 2:
- Escalate to a **12-hour Server/Game Ban**.
- Record the prior warning/watchlist context and the repeated conduct.
```

## Escalation Modifiers

Use these modifiers to move up or down the path:

| Modifier | Direction | Effect |
|:---------|:----------|:-------|
| New player confusion with good-faith correction | De-escalate | Prefer coaching; add a note only when an on-record rulebreak entry is still warranted |
| Prompt compliance after contact | De-escalate | Stop at minimal necessary action |
| Repeat behavior after prior notice | Escalate | Move to note/watchlist or stronger action |
| Refusal, evasion, or bad faith conduct | Escalate | Skip levels where needed |
| Severe round-integrity harm | Escalate | Immediate stronger intervention is appropriate |
